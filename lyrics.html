"reputable institutions"<br>
<br>
you sit and attempt to graft your personal experiences onto <br>
some heirarchy of meaning and/or worth<br>
publishing stories through reputable institutions seems worthwhile<br>
attacked by memories or something<br>
remembering things you wrote about memories you had<br>
memories are now remembrances of fictionalized versions<br>
of your memories<br>
grafting personal experiences onto heirarchies of something<br>
george berkeley's vision of experience<br>
historically it wasn't uncommon to be burnt alive for your visions<br>
radical politics endorsed by jamie dimon<br>
publishing stories through reputable institutions seems worthwhile<br>
radical writers writing radical words<br>
everyone agrees with<br>
reputable institutions are worthwhile<br>

"the pages of wikipedia"<br>
<br>
joe biden assisted the financial industry<br>
in disallowing the expungement of student loans through bankruptcy<br>
osama bin laden was an ardent believer<br>
in climate change, he felt it was a huge threat<br>
in the early years of american history<br>
it was more socially acceptable to kill a person of african ancestry<br>
than to fornicate with one<br>
there are credible accusations of widespread pedophilia<br>
that have little to no detail in the pages of wikipedia<br>
<br>
we will have a real cool time tonight<br>
i said we will have a real cool time tonight<br>

"the price of lemons"<br>
<br>
existential dread is still commercially viable<br>
fielding text messages can be cumbersome<br>
society's rules can be situational<br>
owning pets is a vicious masquerade<br>
middle names are no longer necessary<br>
they may even be authoritarian<br>
scent transmutes stop & shops into lost loves<br>
<br>
she screamed i needed to put some gel in my hair<br>
i didn't necessarily disagree<br>
out with friends<br>
having good times<br>
bonds dissolve like alka seltzer plus<br>
muscle memory leads to pollution<br>
i saw a guy at the gym <br>
who looked a lot like muammar gaddafi<br>
the guy died with a bayonet shoved up his ass <br>
in the middle of the street<br>
sometimes it seems like nothing really changes<br>

<p>
"quasi-erotic oblivions"<br>
<br>
all seemingly inconsequential edits require a click save<br>
otherwise they're lost forever<br>
into an oblivion of squandered possibilities<br>
i've noticed i've become less aware of my interactions<br>
with cashiers in recent years<br>
kind of makes you wonder<br>
what else are we unaware of<br>
staring into the blackened water<br>
of the pond behind my apartment<br>
the ducks don't seem to know any better<br>
sometimes i feel a sense of calm come over me<br>
other times the conclusion seems appropriately close<br>

"breathing oxygen"<br>
<br>
the pointlessness of breathing oxygen<br>
becomes more tenable with age,<br>
sitting at a bar<br>
i contemplated ways for me to no longer<br>
feel feelings<br>
standing at a sink<br>
with my head underwater<br>
i considered leaving my head underwater<br>
eating wendy's french fries<br>
i felt like a new man.<br>
capitalist economies are designed <br>
for us to enjoy french fries<br>

</p>

<p>

"novelistic endeavors"<br>
<br>
to mark distinctions<br>
in what your senses say they see<br>
is a novelistic endeavor<br>
across the street from birch middle school<br>
a family of rich people are buried<br>
the graves are all chipped and shit<br>
i don't think they distinguish things anymore<br>
i sit at home and paint a picture<br>
totally disgusted<br>
thinking about people like peggy guggenheim<br>
making fortunes off of other people's paintings<br>

</p>

<br>

<p>

"historical concerns"<br>
<br>
historical atrocities are the driving force of history<br>
i've never respected mathematicians<br>
mathematicians are religious zealots to me<br>
to me the idea of efficient markets<br>
is no different than radical islam<br>
i took an exotic dancer out for lunch<br>
and was filled with nonsensical bourgeois concerns<br>

</p>

<br>

<p>

"detailed records"<br>
<br>
keeping detailed records of the amount of alcoholic beverages i imbibe<br>
jumped over a fence drunk one time<br>
landed on my face in a patch of rocks<br>
ran off bloodied and drove to a bar<br>
my sister's college graduation party was marred by my behavior<br>
four beers<br>
had my butthole inspected by tsa a few times after 9/11<br>
nothing matters<br>
youth feels like a trillion years ago<br>
all my dreams still occur in that house i grew up in<br>
i dont know what any of them mean<br>

</p>

<br>

<p>

"life is dream-like"<br>
<br>
an ambulance wails<br>
tyrannically down the street<br>
and i realize i hate salads<br>
from pizza spots<br>
so often life is dream-like<br>
leaving the restaurant<br>
we took note of a <br>
bald middle aged man<br>
clutching his stomach <br>
in grave pain<br>
when she called to tell me<br>
she got engaged<br>
i wrote down the date <br>
in a small notenbook<br>
yet in hindsight<br>
this didn't change anything<br>
