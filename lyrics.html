"reputable institutions"<br>
<br>
you sit and attempt to graft your personal experiences onto <br>
some heirarchy of meaning and/or worth<br>
publishing stories through reputable institutions seems worthwhile<br>
attacked by memories or something<br>
remembering things you wrote about memories you had<br>
memories are now remembrances of fictionalized versions<br>
of your memories<br>
grafting personal experiences onto heirarchies of something<br>
george berkeley's vision of experience<br>
historically it wasn't uncommon to be burnt alive for your visions<br>
radical politics endorsed by jamie dimon<br>
publishing stories through reputable institutions seems worthwhile<br>
radical writers writing radical words<br>
everyone agrees with<br>
reputable institutions are worthwhile<br>

"the pages of wikipedia"<br>
<br>
joe biden assisted the financial industry<br>
in disallowing the expungement of student loans through bankruptcy<br>
osama bin laden was an ardent believer<br>
in climate change, he felt it was a huge threat<br>
in the early years of american history<br>
it was more socially acceptable to kill a person of african ancestry<br>
than to fornicate with one<br>
there are credible accusations of widespread pedophilia<br>
that have little to no detail in the pages of wikipedia<br>

"the price of lemons"<br>
<br>
existential dread is still commercially viable<br>
fielding text messages can be cumbersome<br>
society's rules can be situational<br>
owning pets is a vicious masquerade<br>
middle names are no longer necessary<br>
they may even be authoritarian<br>
scent transmutes stop & shops into lost loves<br>
<br>
she screamed i needed to put some gel in my hair<br>
i didn't necessarily disagree<br>
out with friends<br>
having good times<br>
bonds dissolve like alka seltzer plus<br>
muscle memory leads to pollution<br>
i saw a guy at the gym <br>
who looked a lot like muammar gaddafi<br>
the guy died with a bayonet shoved up his ass <br>
in the middle of the street<br>
sometimes it seems like nothing really changes<br>

"quasi-erotic oblivions"<br>
<br>
all seemingly inconsequential edits require a click save<br>
otherwise they're lost forever<br>
into an oblivion of squandered possibilities<br>
i've noticed i've become less aware of my interactions<br>
with cashiers in recent years<br>
kind of makes you wonder<br>
what else are we unaware of<br>
staring into the blackened water<br>
of the pond behind my apartment<br>
the ducks don't seem to know any better<br>
sometimes i feel a sense of calm come over me<br>
other times the conclusion seems appropriately close<br>

"breathing oxygen"<br>
<br>
the pointlessness of breathing oxygen<br>
becomes more tenable with age,<br>
sitting at a bar<br>
i contemplated ways for me to no longer<br>
feel feelings<br>
standing at a sink<br>
with my head underwater<br>
i considered leaving my head underwater<br>
eating wendy's french fries<br>
i felt like a new man.<br>
capitalist economies are designed <br>
for us to enjoy french fries<br>
