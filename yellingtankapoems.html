FATUOUS LIES<br>
<br>
watching tv i<br>
solemnly realized my claim<br>
<br>
to sobriety<br>
was some sort of fatuous<br>
lie, scotch may not be my friend<br>
<br>
<br>
JUVENILE ATHLETICS<br>
<br>
juveniles in this<br>
country are forced to compete <br>
<br>
in sporting events <br>
organized by resident<br>
imbeciles and pedophiles<br>
<br>
<br>
REMINISCING ON THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR<br>
<br>
george orwell said that<br>
journalists were pernicious<br>
<br>
actors when it came<br>
to the spanish civil war,<br>
they may still tell fibs today<br>
<br>
<br>
WORKING OUT MY BICEPS<br>
<br>
i enjoy having<br>
sex as much as the next guy<br>
<br>
but i don't like all<br>
of this flexing of muscle, <br>
our biceps aren't penises<br>
<br>
<br>
THE TRUE INTENTIONS OF THE STRAIGHT-A STUDENT<br>
<br>
these straight-a students <br>
are future murderers, they<br>
<br>
turn blind eyes to our<br>
inconvenient questions and<br>
enjoy hagiography<br>
<br>
<br>
MY YIA YIA<br>
<br>
i had a dream my<br>
yia yia sat in a wheelchair<br>
<br>
and told a guy she<br>
was someone she wasn't, so <br>
i said sir that's my yia yia<br>
<br>
<br>
FEEDING DUCKS<br>
<br>
feeding ducks i thought<br>
about numbers, and how we<br>
<br>
don't know for sure they<br>
don't have personalities,<br>
maybe number three's a dick<br>
<br>
<br>
C. CONKLIN<br>
<br>
i saw chris conklin<br>
in line at rite aid, he looked<br>
<br>
twenty years older<br>
and i thought eventually<br>
the two of us will be dead<br>
<br>
<br>
COW BUTTS<br>
<br>
our latest findings<br>
in science suggest when cows<br>
<br>
fart profane methane <br>
gas is released, from cow butt<br>
emerges pure pollution<br>
<br>
<br>
THE SEA (ASIA MINOR 1913-1922)<br>
<br>
while alive they tugged <br>
out her intestines and with<br>
<br>
her blood pouring out<br>
she said my child, when you see<br>
the dark fall into the sea<br>
