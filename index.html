WHAT'S A COMPUTER follows former Federal Reserve Chairman PAUL VOLCKER as he sips an affordably priced beer in his rented cottage on the southern tip of Toulon, France. With a wide variety of cereal boxes assembled on his kitchen table, he strenuously contemplates which brand he'll choose to pour of a bowl of for dinner, crooning in drone-like intonations as he makes this crucial decision.
<br>
<br>
The structures of songs presented on WHAT'S A COMPUTER are loosely based on the Rembetiko style of the Greek underground music, featuring sparse live instrumentation, slower tempos, droning-like vocals, and a verse-instrumental rather than verse-chorus structure.
