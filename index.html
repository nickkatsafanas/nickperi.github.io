WHAT'S A COMPUTER is an America rock opera inspired by the book SECRETS OF THE TEMPLE by WILLIAM GREIDER and aesthetically influenced by the modern American operas of ROBERT ASHLEY and GHOSTFACE KILLAH, the novels of Austrian writer THOMAS BERNHARD, and the Rebetiko music of Greek singer HARIS ALEXIOU.

WHAT'S A COMPUTER follows former Federal Reserve Chairman PAUL VOLCKER as he sips an affordably priced beer in his rented Toulon, France cottage. With a handful of cereal boxes laid out on his kitchen table, he strenuously contemplates which brand he'd like a bowl of for dinner, muttering in drone-like intonations as he makes this crucial decision.
