PAUL VOLCKER'S DILEMMA follows former Federal Reserve Chairman as he sips an affordably priced beer in his rented cottage on the tip of Toulon, France. With a plethora of heterogeneous cereal boxes sprawled across his kitchen table, he strenuously contemplates which brand he'd like a bowl of for dinner. He picks up his trusty mandolin and croons a few feelings, expecting the process will assist him in making this crucial decision.
